              <p>“There are tons of apps out there for fantasy football, BUT there are few that actually provide solid fantasy advice from REAL people. A lot of apps depends on algorithms and data give you “the best advice around…” This app is a community of people who play and love fantasy football. Sometimes you don’t need a “cut and dry” answer, you need to talk it out with actual people. Great advice/insight with even better people in the community. It simply doesn’t get better than this. Absolutely invaluable.”</p>

          <h2>4. Conditions of Participation</h2>
          <div class="level second">
            <p>4.1 Registration-
            In order to participate in a contest on the Service, you must register for an account. By registering as a user of the Service, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted (such information being the “Registration Data”) and maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Fantasy Life has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Fantasy Life may deny you access to areas requiring registration, or terminate your account, at its sole discretion.</p>

            <p><b>4.2 Account Password and Security-</b>
            At the time of registration for online account access, you must provide a valid email address and supply a Username and Password to be used in conjunction with your account. You may not use a Username that promotes a commercial venture or a Username that Fantasy Life in its sole discretion deems offensive. Many portions of the Service require registration for access (the "Restricted Areas"). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Username and Password, and are fully responsible for all uses of your Username and Password, whether by you or others. You agree to (a) never to use the same Password for the Service that you use or have ever used outside of the Service; (b) keep your Username and Password confidential and not share them with anyone else; (c) immediately notify Fantasy Life of any unauthorized use of your Username and Password or account or any other breach of security; and (d) use only your own Username and Password to access the Service’s Restricted Areas. Fantasy Life cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section.</p>

            <p>You acknowledge and agree that Fantasy Life is authorized to act on instructions received through the use of your Username and Password, and that Fantasy Life may, but is not obligated to, deny access or block any transaction made through use of your Username and Password without prior notice if we believe your Username and Password are being used by someone other than you, or for any other reason.
            Fantasy Life may require you to change your Username or may unilaterally change your Username.</p>

            <p><b>4.3 Communications and Information Practices-</b>
            As a result of your registration for the Service, you may receive certain commercial communications from Fantasy Life. You understand and agree that these communications are part of your registration, and that, to the extent required by law, you may opt out of receiving these communications at any time by either using the unsubscribe functionality. Following such an opt-out, we may still communicate with you via email to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

            <p><b>4.4 Disqualification and Cancellation-</b>
            Fantasy Life, in its sole discretion, may disqualify from the entire Service, or suspend, limit, or terminate your account if you engage in conduct Fantasy Life deems, in its sole discretion, to be improper, unfair, fraudulent or otherwise adverse to the operation of the Service or in any way detrimental to other users. Improper conduct includes, but is not limited to: falsifying personal information, violating any of these rules; tampering with the administration of the Service or trying to in any way tamper with the computer programs associated with the Service; and abusing the Service in any way; or otherwise violating these Terms of Use.</p>

            <p>If for any reason the Service is not running as originally planned (e.g., if the Site becomes corrupted or does not allow the proper usage and processing of entries in accordance with the rules, or if infection by a computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, actions by entrants, fraud, technical failures, or any other causes of any kind, in the sole opinion of Fantasy Life corrupts or affects the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of the Service), Fantasy Life reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any individual implicated in or relating to the cause and/or to cancel, terminate, extend, modify or suspend the Service. If such cancellation, termination, modification or suspension occurs, notification may be posted on the Site.
            The failure of Fantasy Life to comply with any provision of these Terms due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, riot, earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of governmental authorities outside of the control of Fantasy Life (excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations) or other force majeure event will not be considered a breach of these Terms.</p>

          <h2>15.1 Initial Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <div class="level second">
            <p>Our Customer Support Department is available via email support@fantasylifeapp.com to address any concerns you may have regarding the Service. Our Customer Service Department is able to resolve most concerns quickly to our players’ satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts through this Customer Service process to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>

            <p><b>15.2 Choice of Forum and Law-</b>
            Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, and except as set forth below under the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provision, all disputes arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or the Service shall be brought exclusively in state or federal court in New York, New York. This Agreement, and all access to or use of the Service, shall be governed by New York law.</p>

            <p><b>15.3 Binding Arbitratio-</b>
            This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the FAA, and not by any state law concerning arbitration.
            </br>
            If you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, neither you nor we will have the right to: (1) have a court or a jury decide the claim; (2) participate in a class action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative or a class member; (3) act as a private attorney general in court or in arbitration; or (4) join or consolidate your claim(s) with claims of any other person or involving any other transaction.
            </br>
            If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
            </br>
            The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            </br>
            The Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1.800.778.7879. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Fantasy Life will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Fantasy Life will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>

            <p><b>15.4 Effect of Arbitration Award-</b>
            Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator's award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for: (1) any appeal right under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§1 et seq. (the "FAA"); and (2) claims involving more than $100,000. For claims involving more than $100,000, any party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel appointed by the Administrator, which will reconsider anew any aspect of the initial award that is appealed. The panel's decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. The costs of any appeal will be borne in accordance with the paragraph below captioned "Location And Costs."</p>

            <p><b>15.5 Location and Costs-</b>
            Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient for you. If you cannot afford or otherwise do not want to pay the Administrator's or arbitrator's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver of fees from the Administrator, we will consider in good faith any request by you for Fantasy Life to bear the cost of those fees. We will pay for our own attorneys, experts and witnesses and will pay the reasonable fees and charges of your attorneys, experts and witnesses if you win the arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator. We will pay any administration fee, arbitration fees and fees and charges of attorneys, experts and witnesses if and to the extent we are required to pay such fees and charges by law or in order to make this Arbitration Provision enforceable.  </p>

            <p><b>15.6 Class Action Waiver-</b>
            Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, if you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, neither you nor we will have the right to: (1) participate in a class action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative, class member or class opponent; (2) act as a private attorney general in court or in arbitration; or (3) join or consolidate your Claims with claims of any other person or involving any other transaction, and the arbitrator shall have no authority to conduct any such class, private attorney general or multiple-party proceeding.   The parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND FANTASY LIFE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

            <p><b>15.7 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims-</b>
            Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p>
